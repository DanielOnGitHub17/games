            These games should be fun to play (depending on who you are).
            However, I must admit that they are not heavy on design 🙂.
            I made them to learn programming, wanting to see my work represented
            on a screen and movable.

        <h3>Games</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                <span>Shoot</span>
                Shoot is cool. With some customizations, you and/or a friend can 
                clear a world of your computerized enemies.
                Also, if you do not want to shoot bots, you can shoot each other.
                Thus, friends and enemies are all welcome to play.
                Please, play it on a laptop. You can always share your keyboard with a frenemy.

            <p>
                <span>Coins</span>
                This game virtually helps you fly on a blue sky, collecting golden coins
                and dodging black ones as you go.
                While you can use arrow keys to play with a keyboard, 
                this game is best played on a phone.

            <p>
                <span>Colors</span>
                Colors display mixed random colors in a grid (a flex box, actually), wanting you
                exchange any two to eliminate all matches.
                Made for my little sister, this game is simple to play on all devices.

            <p>
                <span>Grass Clear</span>
                The prospect of moving a small man around a maze, trying to remove all green life
                might not be environmentally friendly, so let's pretend he would replant them
                somewhere else in the memory.
                Using your arrow keys, show your grass clearing skills in this game while 
                breaking blocks (X) to make way for your self.

            <p>
                <span>Ludo</span>
                Although not yet fully implemented, this game mimics the 
                popular and interesting board game, aiding you to move counters around the virtual board.
                It also offers customizations for more than one player.
                Built using CSS grid, the online board is almost as attractive as the real one.

            <p>
                <span>Combat 3D</span>
                It is not very simple to implement 3D programming by using only basic JavaScript.
                I stopped working on this game when I determined to learn threeJS.
                Hopefully, I would complete it when I have more knowledge on three.

            <p>
                <span>Block Breaker</span>
                The typical, more mediocre, block breaker game.
                Official levels are okay, but try completing random ones.
                Perfect or not. I still like the game implementation of application screens.

            <p>
                <span>Whot</span>
                While not artificially intelligent, the bot in this game could still beat you at 
                this Nigerian card game.
                My online version is easy to play. The only rules are to match the
                middle card with cards you own, double clicking the 'market' if you 
                are short on cards.
                You win when you have no cards left.

            <p>
                <span>Float</span>
                Keep hitting the arrow key to keep up with gravity (or code bringing you down).
                Destroy all your perfectly floating enemies as you try not to 'sink'.
                Through cliking and hitting a arrow keys, you can become a true floater...

            <p>
                <span>Tap</span>
                This one was the first I made. See how fast you can click.
                If you get the circle to the end of you screen, you win.
